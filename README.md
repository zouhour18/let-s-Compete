# Problem 1 : Play With Numbers
Some numbers have funny properties.

For example:
```

89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1

695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2

46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51

```
Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p
we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such as the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k * n.

In other words 
Is there an integer k such as 
```

 (a ^ p + b ^ (p+1) + c ^(p+2) + d ^ (p+3) + ...) = n * k
 
```
If it is the case we will return **k**, if not return **-1**.

***Note: n and p will always be given as strictly positive integers.***

**Example**
```

digPow(89, 1) should return 1 since 8¹ + 9² = 89 = 89 * 1
digPow(92, 1) should return -1 since there is no k such as 9¹ + 2² equals 92 * k
digPow(695, 2) should return 2 since 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2
digPow(46288, 3) should return 51 since 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51

```

# Problem 2 : To Binary

Given a non-negative integer **n**, write a function ***to_binary/ToBinary*** which returns that number in a binary format.
```

to_binary(1)  # should return 1 
to_binary(5)  # should return 101
to_binary(11) # should return 1011

```

# Problem 3 : A to Z

Given a string as input, return a new string with each letter pushed to the right by its respective index in the alphabet.

We all know that A is a slow and Z is a fast letter. 
This means that Z gets shifted to the right by 25 spaces, A doesn't get shifted at all, and B gets shifted by 1 space.

You can assume the following things about your input:

- It will only contain uppercase letters from A to Z, no whitespaces or punctuation
- Input strings will not exceed 100 characters (although your output string might!)

**Note that if 2 or more letters fall onto the same space after shifting, the latest character will be used. For example: "BA" -> " A"**

**Examples**
```

"AZ"   -->  "A                         Z"
"ABC"  -->  "A B C"
"ACE"  -->  "A  C  E"
"CBA"  -->  "  A"
"HELLOWORLD"  -->  "     E H    DLL   OLO   R  W"

```

# Problem 4 : Hangman 

Hangman is a game where you must guess letters of the alphabet to complete a word given the length. 
You have decided you want to impress your friends with your hangman skills and create a program given a list of predefined words that can complete any hangman guess first time!

###### Task 
- You must implement the Machine class that takes a word list and returns a player class that takes a length of the word you must guess. 

- You must then make guesses returning letters of the alphabet to complete the word within 11 failed guesses, as a response you will receive a string representation of the letters found and the letters remaining unknown. 

**Examples**
```

word: printable

guess: a
response: _____a___

guess: b
response: _____a___

guess: p
response: p____a___

```

# Problem 5 : Infinite Sequence 

Consider the following array:

```
[1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1234567, 12345678, 123456789, 12345678910, 1234567891011...]
```

If we join these blocks of numbers, we come up with an infinite sequence which starts with 112123123412345123456.... The list is infinite.

You will be given an number **(n)** and your task will be to return the element at that index in the sequence, where **1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18**. Assume the indexes start with **1**, not **0**.

***For example:***

```

solve(1) = 1, because the first character in the sequence is 1. There is no index 0. 
solve(2) = 1, because the second character is also 1.
solve(3) = 2, because the third character is 2.

```

# Problem 6 : The dots and parentheses

The following task has two parts. 

- First you must figure out the principle behind the following encoding of natural numbers. 
- The table below displays the encoding of the numbers from 0 to 11.

| Number | Code |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | '.' |
| 1 | '()' |
| 2 | '(())' |
| 3 | '(.())' |
| 4 | '((()))' |
| 5 | '(..())' |
| 6 | '(()())' |
| 7 | '(...())' |
| 8 | '((.()))' |
| 9 | '(.(()))' |
| 10 | '(().())' |
| 11 | '(....())' |

Once you understand how the numbers are encoded, write a program which encodes a given natural number and return it as a string.

**Values from 0 to 10000 will be checked**
